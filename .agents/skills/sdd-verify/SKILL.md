# SDD Verify

## Activation Contract

Use when `sdd next` returns `verify` and either the recorded pace is automatic or Verify is entered from a new explicit user continuation after a pace boundary; an explicit user request to verify also authorizes entry. A `next_phase: verify` result produced inside semi-supervised Apply does not authorize this skill in that same continuation. This is a semantic quality gate for the current delivery unit, not PR review.

## User Authorization Override

These instructions are operational guidance. With explicit user authorization, bypass or replace this skill's guidance after briefly stating the affected safeguard; do not treat the skill as an independent veto.

## Hard Rules

- Execute tests; inspection alone is not verification.
- Judge only the current delivery unit; future-slice tasks are not incomplete evidence.
- Map every applicable task and scenario to implementation code, an executed covering test, and asserted observable outcomes.
- A scenario is `COMPLIANT` only when its test reaches the trigger and asserts every relevant THEN. Weak existence/non-null assertions, unreachable triggers, and snapshot-only evidence are insufficient.
- Attempt adversarial refutation: inspect invalid states, boundaries, side effects, regressions, assertion strength, and whether tests can pass without the behavior.
- Classify findings as `CRITICAL`, `WARNING`, or `SUGGESTION`; missing strict evidence is CRITICAL.
- Direct remediation is allowed only for an unequivocal violation of an existing task/spec/design contract. It may span the files necessary inside the active unit, has no arbitrary size limit, and must not add functionality or make a product decision.
- For direct remediation, add a meaningful RED test, implement the smallest GREEN correction, triangulate where useful, rerun affected tests, update `tasks.md`, Files Changed, findings, and this report, and re-review affected requirements.
- Ambiguous or out-of-contract findings must not be changed; record FAIL or blocked and route to `sdd-refactor`.
- Preserve each verification cycle at `verify-reports/{unit}.md` or the allocated `verify-reports/{unit}-{cycle:03}.md`; never overwrite an earlier cycle.
- For correction/spec, inspect the active unit's `refactors/{unit}.md` revisions (and legacy `refactor.md` compatibility evidence) plus immutable prior reports. Brief feedback is represented by tasks/specs and has no refactor artifact.
- If Pending documentation has no matching same-cycle deferral, offer **Update documentation** or explicit continuation. Consume a matching deferral from the immediately preceding refactor loop without prompting twice. On continuation, record a stable debt ID, `pending` state, and brief description; on completion, record the same ID as `resolved`.
- A documentation debt may produce `PASS WITH WARNINGS` only when no other blocker exists. Reevaluate unresolved debt in every later cycle or revision and never carry a decision to another unit.
- In automatic pace, call `sdd-deliver-pr` without prompting after PASS/PASS WITH WARNINGS and completed-unit gates.
- In semi-supervised pace, the initial verify for a slice must pause with `awaiting_delivery`; explicit continuation reuses the PASS when no refactor event is uncovered and authorizes delivery of only the active slice. Review or QA changes must first use `sdd-refactor`, whose uncovered event requires verification.
- In supervised pace, explicit approval is required before that handoff.
- For the final unit of `chained-pr`, include a `## Feature PR Recommendation` section with `delivery.feature_base_branch` as head and `delivery.base_branch` as base. State explicitly that creation is optional and archive remains permitted; verification never creates the PR.

## Inputs

- current delivery unit and changed files
- applicable tasks, intent, correction/spec, proposal, and design
- `tasks.md`, prior `verify-reports/{unit}*.md`, and non-brief refactor evidence when present
- repository test/build/quality commands

## Verification Method

Build the full report defined in the verify contract: Completeness, Build & Tests Execution, Files Changed, the Spec Compliance Matrix mapping requirement/scenario to implementation path, an Executed test, and Asserted outcomes, TDD Compliance, Changed File Coverage, Coherence, Assertion Quality, classified Findings, remediation/re-review evidence, limitations, PR Readiness, and Verdict. Derive TDD Compliance from `tasks.md`, the diff, executed tests, and assertions, including a meaningful second case when applicable. Inspect assertions, not merely test names or green output.

## Execution Steps

1. Read the required contracts, current artifacts, all prior cycles, and the active unit's evidence.
2. Resolve commands from the project profile, then `pyproject.toml`, package/task configuration, or CI. Run configured tests and lint/type/build commands; mark categories `Not configured` only when no source defines them.
3. Execute named tests and real-file integration tests for filesystem behavior when available.
4. Build the semantic matrix and attempt refutation of every applicable task/scenario.
5. Evaluate unit-scoped `Pending Documentation Change` states before the verdict: consume an immediately preceding same-cycle deferral once, otherwise prompt for synchronization or explicit debt continuation and persist the stable debt ID in the new report.
6. If an existing-contract violation is determined, perform strict RED/GREEN/TRIANGULATE/REFACTOR remediation and re-review it. Otherwise classify the finding and route to refactor without inventing behavior.
7. Persist the next collision-free `verify-reports/{unit}` cycle, including documentation debt state, findings, corrections, limitations, final verdict, and the final chained `## Feature PR Recommendation` when applicable; run `sdd check --change <change>`.
8. On PASS/PASS WITH WARNINGS, run `sdd advance verify --change <change>`.
9. Apply PR authorization after all are true: verdict is PASS/PASS WITH WARNINGS, current-unit tasks are complete, `sdd check` passes, and `sdd advance verify` succeeds. Persist `Covered Refactors`. In automatic pace call `sdd-deliver-pr` without prompting; in semi-supervised pace pause after the initial pass and require explicit continuation, reusing the PASS when no refactor event is uncovered; in supervised pace ask for approval.
10. After delivery or an explicit skip, run `sdd next --change <change>`. Automatic pace continues through slices without merge waits; semi-supervised pace pauses at each delivery boundary and at archive. When final chained delivery returns the create-or-skip recommendation, let `sdd-resume` route the optional Feature PR decision to `sdd-deliver-pr`; otherwise route archive normally. After that optional decision, run `sdd archive --change <change>` when pace permits unless review or an explicit stop-before-archive instruction wins. The optional PR never changes the verification verdict or archive eligibility.
